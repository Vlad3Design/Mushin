# 無心 Mushin - A Zen-Inspired Obsidian Theme

> *"The mind of no-mind, the flowing state of pure awareness"*

**Mushin** (無心) is an Obsidian theme that embodies the Japanese zen concept of "no-mind" - a state of mental clarity, effortless flow, and pure focus. This theme transforms your note-taking experience into a journey of mental tranquility and enhanced productivity.

## 🔌 Recommended Plugins

This theme works best with the plugins **[MindfulDo](https://github.com/Vlad3Design/MindfulDo)** & **[FadeLine](https://github.com/Vlad3Design/FadeLine)**.
