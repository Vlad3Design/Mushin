## 🎋 Design Philosophy

Mushin follows these core principles:

- **Simplicity** (簡素 - Kanso): Remove all unnecessary elements
- **Naturalness** (自然 - Shizen): Use colors and forms found in nature  
- **Subtlety** (幽玄 - Yugen): Create depth through suggestion, not decoration
- **Tranquility** (静寂 - Seijaku): Foster peace and mental clarity

## 🧘 Recommended Workflow

1. **Morning Setup**: Switch to light mode for energizing morning sessions
2. **Focus Sessions**: Use with Obsidian's focus mode for deep work
3. **Evening Reflection**: Switch to dark mode for contemplative writing
4. **Mindful Breaks**: Let the breathing space guide natural rest periods
